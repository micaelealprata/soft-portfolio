## I am a Data Science postgrad that actually wants to develop stuff. 

My name is Micael. I am currently doing a MSc in Data Science in Coventry University, and expected to graduate with a First in December 2020. Although I decided to follow Data Science after completing my BSc in Computer Science and Business Management in ISCTE-IUL (Lisbon), my ambition towards becoming a Data Scientist started fading away and motivation trailed off midway through studies. However, I persisted and continued investing a lot of my time to get good grades because I believed this was just momentaneous. But ever since the pandemic started, I have reflected more on my future and where I should invest my time working.

I though of Scuba Diving. This was something I hadn't done in many years, but I was only missing the Divemaster course, with which I would be able to mentor fellow scuba divers and have an amazing job by the sea.

I thought also of Technical Writing. I am really fond of writing, and every night I leave some time before bed to reflect on my day. If I coupled my love for writing while delving my nose in new and trendy tech stacks, I would never become obsolete and become amazing on the art of the w̶r̶i̶t̶t̶e̶n̶  typed word.

In the end, Software Engineering came to stay. This decision was really easy to make. Personally, I like to keep my hobbies separate of my job, but I still want to work on something that I actually enjoy doing and keeps challenging me every day. And I love coding! I wanted to do something meaningful and I thought Data Science was the right next step for me, because I thought I would be working on projects that would revolutionise the world. But would they revolutionise me? I wasn't sure. 

I know where I am going next. I am choosing Software Engineering.
